### About SMACSS
The first pretty interesting methodology that I used is SMACSS which stands for Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS is an approach to web development written by, Jonathan Snook.To know more, go to : http://smacss.com 

SMACSS subdivides CSS rules to 5 categories:

- [Base Rules]: 
contains the rules that define the default elements styling for all occurrences on the page.
- [Layout Rules]: 
contains the style of the major components of the page like header, main, footer, navigation
- [Module Rules]: 
a Module is a more discrete component of the page. It is your navigation bars and your carousels and your dialogs and your widgets and so on. This is the meat of the page. Modules sit inside Layout components.
- [State Rules]:
A state is something that augments and overrides all other styles.
- [Theme Rules]:
Theme Rules aren't as often used within a project, a theme defines colors and images that give your application or site its look and feel.
